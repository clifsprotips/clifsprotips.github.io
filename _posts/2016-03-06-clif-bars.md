title: Clif Bars for Lunch
---
Clif's inaugural pro tip is about eating lunch on the ski slopes. In short,
you shouldn't, and here's why:

* $12 hamburgers
* inconvenient
* you'll get all warm and lazy and won't want to ski afterwards
* you'll have to hope that your skis are still there when you come back (or use
a crappy ski lock)

F that. Just pack a few of these guys and you can eat your lunch
on the lift.

Bonus tip: if your ski buddies happen to be allergic to peanuts, choose
your bars wisely and you might not have to share.
