title: Clif Bars for Lunch
---
Clif's inaugural pro tip is about eating lunch on the ski slopes. In short,
you shouldn't, and here's why:

* overpriced
* inconvenient
* you'll get all warm and lazy and won't want to ski afterwards
* you'll have to leave your skis unattended and risk theft, or use a lousy ski lock
(theft doesn't happen often, but if you have nice new skis...)

Yeah, screw that. Just pack a few of these guys and you can eat your lunch
on the lift.

Bonus tip: if your ski buddies happen to be allergic to peanuts, choose
your bars wisely and you might not have to share.
