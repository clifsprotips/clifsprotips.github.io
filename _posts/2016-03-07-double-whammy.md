title: A Tribute to Clif's Ski Gear
---
Before being reincarnated as Clif, my refusal to replace any of my aging ski gear
was a frequent cause for ridicule on ski outings. Below is a sampling
of the old gear, before it leaves for a better place.

The original Double Whammy

One time the zipper got so badly stuck that I had to cut out a piece
of the jacket with a pocket knife. Then most of the zipper just broke off
entirely

A lot of this glove's insides seem to be on its outside

Turns out that blood doesn't come out of wool socks

Unfortunately I don't have any pics of my old skis and boots. When I went to
get them sharpened for this past season, I was told (by a snowboarder working
there):

> Uhh hey brah, do you know these skis are cracked? Also, the bindings are
broken, and I just asked my manager - we can't touch them for liability reasons.

Me: "Well, I mean I know they aren't great, but better than I'd get if I rented
skis at the slopes, right?"

> ... no man. Rental skis would be several steps up from these. And not nearly
as dangerous.

Me: " I see ... well ok, can I sell you my old skis if I buy new ones here?"

(goes to talk with manager)

>  ... My manager says he'll give you $10, but we're
just going to throw them in the dumpster out back.

And so came the new skis, along with lots of other things, much to the
demur of my wife (but I'll leave that for another post)
