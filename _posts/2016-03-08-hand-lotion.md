Clif's hands get real messed up during the winter. I mean, just look at this one:

Gross, I know. Luckily he found this stuff on Amazon - it works super well. Clif recommended.

Clif was not compensated for this review, even though the folks at Cetaphil should
at least send him a few free bottles for his incredibly valuable endorsement.
